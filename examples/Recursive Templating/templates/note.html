<div class="well well-md"><label>NOTE:</label> Each template can have it's own <code>jst/config</code> block which will contain the templates and providers it uses. To avoid confusion and messy code, we urge you to keep all paths relative to the base url, i.e, the main file's path, and use the <code>$BASEURL</code> directive.<div>
